# Nic Goodrich MART 441

## Technical Report

This project got me back into understanding CSS and HTML. Since I took 341 about 2 years ago the only script in these languages I've done has been for creative coding and within site builders like Wordpress and Squarespace, both of which involve minimal script in these languages. The feeling of designing this website 100% is, honestly, empowering. I'm accustomed to feeling trapped within the box of site builders and feel very liberated after finishing this.
