# HW-4 Readme - Nic Goodrich

I struggled a lot with this assignment. I can't confidently finish it, and I made the mistake of not allowing myself enough time to learn the things I didn't know. I've always struggled with understanding 'for loops' and need to work hard on how to get that into a state of strong understanding. The first two problems came to me with only a little bit of research and working. Before this week I was conmfortable with functions in both forms of declaration. It was refreshing to deal with both again, even though I almost always use definition functions. 
Problem 2 was great, because I felt well-versed enough in 'if loops' and min that I was able to work through this one with minimal questions and with direct intentions.
